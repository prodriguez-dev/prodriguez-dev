### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Paul Rodriguez, a Solutions Architect at Auxo Solutions.

My journey from Senior Frontend Engineer to Solutions Architect was driven by a passion for shaping solutions *with* the client, not just for them. Today, I leverage that deep engineering background to translate complex business needs into technical reality on modern platforms like Unqork.
