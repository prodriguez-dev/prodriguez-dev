### Hi there! 👋 I'm Paul Rodriguez, a Solutions Architect at Auxo Solutions.

I've always believed the best technology is built with people at its heart. After years as a Senior Frontend Engineer deep in the codebase, I realized my passion wasn't just in *building* the solution, but in *shaping* it with the client.

Today, I use my hands-on engineering background to design and deliver enterprise-grade applications, translating complex business needs into technical reality on modern platforms like Unqork.

-   🌱 I’m currently focused on architecting scalable integrations and mentoring development teams on SDLC best practices.
-   💬 Ask me about **System Design**, **Low-Code/No-Code Strategy**, or **translating executive vision into a technical roadmap**.

### What I Do as a Solutions Architect

I bridge the gap between client vision and technical execution. My role is a blend of architectural strategy, client collaboration, and technical leadership to deliver tailored, high-impact solutions.

-   **Client Collaboration:** I work directly with stakeholders to conduct discovery, gather requirements, and document business needs using tools like LucidChart, Figma, and Jira.
-   **Solution Delivery:** I architect, develop, and deploy full-stack enterprise applications, leading projects from conception to on-time delivery and integrating with client systems via RESTful APIs.
-   **Technical Leadership:** I create and present technical proofs-of-concept (POCs), provide technical guidance to project teams, and enjoy mentoring colleagues through configuration reviews and knowledge sharing.
